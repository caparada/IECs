# Abstract

#### Background/Objectives
Intracranial Epidermoid Cysts (IECs) are rare intracranial tumors primarily treated through surgery. Cyst adherence complicates complete removal, leading to high rates of tumor progression after subtotal resection. The molecular drivers of IEC remain unknown. Consequently, advances in treatment have fallen short. Tumor genetic profiling has revealed potential targets for drug development, including FDA-approved options and reshaping treatment. The genetic landscape of IECs has not been explored. We applied Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to IECs to gain insights into the mechanisms of oncogenesis and identify potential therapeutic targets. 

#### Methods
We performed WES on tumor tissue and matched blood samples, when available. Following GATK best practices, we conducted read processing, quality control, somatic variant calling, and copy-number inference. Data analyses and visualization were conducted in R. 

#### Results
Top altered genes are associated with the immune system and tumor microenvironment, suggesting a mechanism of immune evasion. Gene and pathway enrichment revealed a high mutation burden in genes associated with Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and PI3K-AKT-mTOR cascades. Recurrent and deleterious alterations in NOTCH2 and USP8 were identified in 50% and 30% of the cohort, respectively. Frequent amplifications in deubiquitinases and beta-defensins strengthened the involvement of immune mechanisms for oncogenic transformation. 

#### Conclusions
Top altered genes and recurrent mutations may play a role in shaping the microenvironment and modulating immune evasion in IECs. USP8 and NOTCH2 may serve as clinically relevant target for IECs. Finally, we present evidence that the crosstalk between the PI3K-Akt-mTOR and ECM signaling pathways may play a role in modulating the immune escape mechanism in IECs.
